Version 0.8.2
-------------

* Fix `short` attachment property by using boolean instead of string
   - This allows to use the plugin with Mattermost
* Fix link to Jenkins jobs with multiple Jenkins backends
   - This was added in cabot 0.11.0

Version 0.8.1
-------------

* Fix slack @mentions not linking correctly
  - Note: It still doesn't work with app webhooks, potentially due to a slack bug
* Only show slack buttons if SLACK_INTERACTIVE_MESSAGES is set to true
  - Some custom config is required on slacks end, so doesn't make sense to show it by default
